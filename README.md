# painting-segmentation
Toolbox of three image segmentation algorithms. The first is a naive region growing/shrining approach. Next is a U-Net with a resnet backbone pretrained on the COCO dataset with options to fine-tune it using the Bob Ros Paintings Dataset. This project aimed to explore classic image segmentation algorithms applied to paintings.
